# Suggestions for improving parsers.py

1. **Error Handling**: The current implementation of the `extract_one_range` function logs a warning and returns `None` when it encounters an invalid range. It might be more beneficial to raise a custom exception that can be caught and handled at a higher level. This would allow for more robust error handling and could make debugging easier.

1. **Code Duplication**: There is some code duplication in the `extract_one_range` function when handling the `.` and `$` cases. This could be refactored into a separate function to improve readability and maintainability.

1. **Function Complexity**: The `parse_range_only` function is quite complex and handles many different cases. It might be beneficial to break this function down into smaller, more manageable functions. This would improve readability and make the code easier to test.

1. **Comments**: While there are some comments in the code, adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and the logic behind more complex code blocks would be beneficial. This would make the code easier to understand for other developers.

1. **Type Annotations**: The code could benefit from more comprehensive type annotations. This would make the code easier to understand and would allow for better static analysis and error checking.

1. **Testing**: There doesn't appear to be any tests for this code. Adding unit tests would help catch any errors or bugs and would make the code more robust.

1. **Code Organization**: The file contains a mix of functions and constants. It might be beneficial to separate these into different files or sections to improve organization and readability.

1. **Naming Conventions**: Some of the variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `RANGE_ONLY` could be renamed to something like `COMMANDS_WITH_ONLY_RANGE` to more accurately reflect its purpose.
