Walruses are large aquatic mammals that live in the Arctic. They are known for their long tusks and large bodies. Walruses use their tusks to help them climb out of the water and onto the ice. They have a layer of blubber that keeps them warm in the cold temperatures. Walruses feed on a diet of clams, mussels, and other benthic invertebrates. They can weigh up to 1.5 tons and reach lengths of up to 12 feet. Walruses are highly social animals and can be found in large groups called herds.
